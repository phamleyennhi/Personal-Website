	<h2> Latent Factor Discovery in Markov Processes through Optimal Transport</h2>
	<p> <i> Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science </i> </p>
	<p>
		This research project is the extension from my participation in the <a href="https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/undergrad/activities-research/summer-undergraduate-research-experience/"> NYU Courant Summer Undergraduate Research Experience 2020 (SURE 2020)</a>. Working under the supervision of Professor Tabak, I reviewed literature about three topics: Markov processes, Optimal Transport, and Barycenter Problems. While traditional hidden Markov models use maximum likelihood to infer the best hidden state sequence z from the given observed sequence x, this new conceptual and computational approach, formulated in the language of optimal transport, explains the variability in x attributable to the latent factor z, as well as the dynamical variability within z itself. Applications abound in various fields, such as pattern recognition, signal processing, and statistical mechanics. The work is accepted to the <a href="https://www.cur.org/what/events/students/ncur/2021/"> National Conference on Undergraduate Research 2021</a>, where I will give a presentation virtually during April 12-14.<br>

	<h2> Terminology Extraction in US Legal Supreme Court Opinions</h2>
	<p> <i> Natural Language Processing </i> </p>
	<p>
		This research project first started when I was taking the course "Special Topics in Computer Science: Natural Language Processing" taught by Professor Adam Meyers. Domain-specific and jargonistic terminology are ubiquitous in legal documents. Despite potential utility in populating glossaries and ontologies or as arguments in information extraction and document classification tasks, there has been limited work done for legal terminology extraction. Thus, we propose a number of specific changes to <a href="https://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/termolator/">the Termolator</a>, a high-performing, open-source terminology extractor which has been tuned to scientific articles in order to gather key terminology from various categories of United States Supreme Court decisions. Unaltered and using the recommended settings, the Termolator provides a list of terminology with a precision of 0.26 for the category of economic activity. My teammate and I improved precision culminating in a combined precision of 0.63. <br>
